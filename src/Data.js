She fill my mind up with ideas
I'm the highest in the room (It's lit)
Hope I make it outta here (Let's go) 

She saw my eyes, she know I'm gone (Ah)
I see some things that you might fear
I'm doin' a show, I'll be back soon (Soon)
That ain't what she wanna hear (Nah)
Now I got her in my room (Ah)
Legs wrapped around my beard
Got the fastest car, it zoom (Skrrt)
Hope we make it outta here (Ah)
When I'm with you, I feel alive
You say you love me, don't you lie (Yeah)
Won't cross my heart, don't wanna die
Keep the pistol on my side (Yeah)

Case it's fumes (Smoke)
She fill my mind up with ideas (Straight up)
I'm the highest in the room (It's lit)
Hope I make it outta here (Let's go, yeah)

We ain't stressin' 'bout the loot (Yeah)
My block made of queser√≠a
This not the molly, this the boot
Ain't no comin' back from here
Live the life of La Familia
It's so much gang that I can't see ya (Yeah)
Turn it up 'til they can't hear (We can't)
Runnin', runnin' 'round for the thrill
Yeah, dawg, dawg, 'round my real (Gang)
Raw, raw, I been pourin' to the real (Drank)
Nah, nah, nah, they not back of the VIP (In the VIP)
Gorgeous, baby, keep me hard as steel
Ah, this my life, I did not choose
Uh, been on this since we was kids
We gon' stay on top and break the rules
Uh, I fill my mind up with ideas

Case it's fumes
She fill my mind up with ideas (Straight up)
I'm the highest in the room (I'm the highest, it's lit)

Do you want to feel how it feels?
Do you want to know that it doesn't hurt me?
Do you want to hear about the deal that I'm making?
You, it's you and me.
If I only could,
I'd make a deal with God,
And I'd get him to swap our places,
Be running up that road,
Be running up that hill,
Be running up that building.
If I only could, oh
You don't want to hurt me,
But see how deep the bullet lies.
Unaware I'm tearing you asunder.
Ooh, there is thunder in our hearts.
Is there so much hate for the ones we love?
Tell me, we both matter, don't we?
You, you and me.
It's you and me won't be unhappy.
If I only could,
I'd make a deal with God,
And I'd get him to swap our places,
Be running up that road,
Be running up that hill,
Be running up that building,
If I only could, oh
C'mon, baby, c'mon darling,
Let me steal this moment from you now.
C'mon, angel, c'mon, c'mon, darling,
Let's exchange the experience, oh
And if I only could,
I'd make a deal with God,
And I'd get him to swap our places,
Be running up that road,
Be running up that hill,
With no problems.
If I only could,
I'd make a deal with God,
And I'd get him to swap our places,
Be running up that road,
Be running up that hill,

Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same
Answer the phone
"Harry, you're no good alone
Why are you sittin' at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?"
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's comin' to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well, oh
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same
Go home, get ahead, light-speed internet
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
Leave America, two kids follow her
I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first
As it was
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was`

Perfect don't mean that it's working
So what can I do? (Ooh)
When you're out of sight
In my mind
'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes
And that's where I find a glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch
But I'm thinking of the way it was
Said I'm fine and said I moved on
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hoping I'll find
A glimpse of us
Tell me he savors your glory
Does he laugh the way I did?
Is this a part of your story?
One that I had never lived
Maybe one day you'll feel lonely
And in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse
Maybe you'll start slipping slowly
And find me again
When you're out of sight
In my mind
'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes
And that's where I find a glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch
But I'm thinking of the way it was
Said I'm fine and said I moved on

Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now
Usually I put
Something on TV
So we never think
About you and me
But today I see
Our reflections
Clearly in Hollywood
Laying on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need something I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now
You can't fight it
You can't breathe
You say something so loving, but
Now I've got to let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now
I just wonder what you're dreaming of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Heat waves been faking me out
Sometimes, all I think about is you

Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now

Yeah, life
Life is only thing we need
They need me to go, but I don't wanna leave
Rest in peace to Lil Keed
Fuck a pigeonhole, I'm a night owl, this a different mode
I might have to make her paint a 6 on her pinky toe
Heard you with a shooting guard, just let a nigga know
I would have you courtside, not the middle row
All good, love, in a minute, though
I can't stress about no bitch 'cause I'm a timid soul
Plus I'm cookin' up ambition on a kitchen stove
Pot start to bubble, see the suds, that shit good to go
Hoes say I'm suave, but I can't get RICO'd
Bro think he John Wayne, I bought him yellow stones
Love the way they hang, babe, fuck the silicone
Everybody fake now, you could crack the code
Bust down everything, set in rose gold
Dread talkin' to you niggas like I'm J. Cole
I can tell her head good before I even know
Bitch, don't tell me that you model if you ain't been in Vogue
Gotta throw a party for my day ones
They ain't in the studio, but they'll lay somethin'
Rest in peace to Drama King, we was straight stuntin'
You don't like the way I talk? Nigga say somethin'
Gotta throw a party for my day ones
Pull up, and you know it's us, the bass jumpin'
You don't like the way I talk? Then say somethin'
Get out my face, nigga
Gotta throw a party for my day ones
They ain't in the studio, but they'll lay somethin'
Rest in peace to Drama King, we was straight stuntin'
If I let my nigga 21 tell it, you a pussy
Spin a block twice like it ain't nowhere to park (21)
Smack the backside of his head like he Bart (pussy)
OVO 4L, we come out when it get dark (21, 21)
Big stepper, he came in a Rolls, but he left in a stretcher (21)
Let my brother drive while I shoot, team effort (21)
Askin' all these questions, bitch, you must think you Nadeska
The chopper like to feel on all the opps, it's a molester (21)
I be with my gun like Rozay be with lemon pepper
She wanna hear some Afrobeats 'cause she just popped a Tesla
All that workin' out, that nigga must think he a wrestler
But this ain't UFC, this chopper came with a compressor (21)
This chopper came with a compressor (pussy)
His chopper came with a- (pussy)
This Glock .45 came with a switch (21)
If I was Will Smith, I would've slapped him with a stick
Put your hands in the air, it's a stick-up (21)
Spin the same hood where I get my dick sucked (facts)
If you standin' on business, put your blick up (21, 21)
Come around actin' scary, get your shit took (21)
Fell in love with feelin' dizzy, so I spizzin (21)
I got mad love for the boy, yeah, that's my twizzin (21)
If them niggas keep on dissin', slide agaizzin (21)
We the reason why the ops ain't got no frizziends (21)
Last nigga played with me got turned duppy
I ain't even roll him in the wood 'cause he musty
You ask how she doin', I just tell her come and fuck me
Shot his ass twenty times, damn, this nigga lucky (damn, that nigga lucky)
Gotta throw a party for my day ones
They ain't in the studio, but they'll lay somethin'
Rest in peace to Drama King, we was straight stuntin'
You don't like the way I talk, nigga, say somethin'
Say somethin', say somethin', say somethin', say somethin', say somethin'
You don't like the way I talk, nigga, say somethin', say somethin'
Say somethin', say somethin', say somethin'`

I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition
Kinda shocking they wanted static with precision, I'm automatic
Quarterback, I ain't talkin' sacking
Pack it, pack it up, I don't panic
Batter, batter up, who the baddest?

Then I went did it again, yeah
I told you long ago, on the road
I got what they waitin' for (I got what they waitin' for)
I don't run from nothin', dog
Get your soldiers, tell 'em I ain't layin' low
(Bitch, I ain't runnin' from no one)
You was never really rootin' for me anyway (like, ooh-ooh)
When I'm back up at the top I wanna hear you say (like, ooh-ooh)
He don't run from nothin', dog
Get your soldiers, tell 'em that the break is over
My track record so clean
They couldn't wait to just bash me
I must be gettin' too flashy
Y'all shouldn't have let the world gas me (woo)
It's too late 'cause I'm here to stay
And these girls know that I'm nasty (mm)
I sent her back to her boyfriend
With my handprint on her ass cheek
City talkin', we takin' notes
Tell 'em all to keep makin' posts
Wish he could but he can't get close
OG so proud of me that he chokin' up while he makin' toasts
I'm the type that you can't control
Said I would then I made it so (so)
I don't clear up rumors (ayy)
Where's y'all sense of humor? (Ayy)
I'm done makin' jokes 'cause they got old like baby boomers
Turn my haters to consumers
I make vets feel like they juniors (juniors)
Say your time is comin' soon but just like Oklahoma (mm)
Mine is comin' sooner (mm)
I'm just a late bloomer (mm)
I didn't peak in high school, I'm still out here gettin' cuter (woo)
All these social networks and computers
Got these pussies walkin' 'round like they ain't losers (losers)
I told you long ago, on the road
I got what they waitin' for (I got what they waitin' for)
I don't run from nothin', dog
Get your soldiers, tell 'em I ain't layin' low
(Bitch, I ain't runnin' from no one)
You was never really rootin' for me anyway (like, ooh-ooh)
When I'm back up at the top I wanna hear you say (like, ooh-ooh)
He don't run from nothin', dog
Get your soldiers, tell 'em that the break is over
Yeah
I'm the industry baby, mm
I'm the industry baby
Yeah`

        ,lyrics:`I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
Strawberries and somethin' more
Ooh yeah, I want it all
Lipstick on my guitar (ooh)
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
Go dancin' underneath the stars
Ooh yeah, I want it all
Mm, you got me feelin' like
I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singin' like
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say, ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
Into the car
On the backseat in the moonlit dark
Wrap me up between your legs and arms
Ooh, I can't get enough
You know you could tear me apart (ooh)
Put me back together and take my heart
I never thought that I could love this hard
Ooh, I can't get enough
Mm, you got me feeling like
I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singin' like
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers

And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
Baby, you burn so hot
You make me shiver with the fire you got
This thing we started, I don't want it to stop
You know you make me shiver-er-er
Baby, you burn so hot
You make me shiver with the fire you got
This thing we started, I don't want it to stop
You know you make me shiver
Yeah, you got me singin' like
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back (oh no)
And we'll say, ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks

I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (oh)
No one's around to judge me (oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
(Hey, hey, hey)
I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh
The city's cold and empty (oh)
No one's around to judge me (oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
I'm just walking by to let you know (by to let you know)
I can never say it on the phone (say it on the phone)
Will never let you go this time (ooh)
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
(Hey, hey, hey)
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch`

Tutte Dil Nu Saambhi Firde

12 Saal Majhiyan Charaiyan
Chadde Takht Hazare Ni
Har Saanh Naal Yaad Tainu Karde Rahe
Koyi Sadde Wang Karuga Taan Pata Lagguga

Dil Naal Laare Ni Tan Laon Waliye

Mere Dil Naal Laare Ni Tu Laun Waliye
Dil Tera Jadon Tuttuga Taan Pata Lagguga

Kehndi Hundi Si Chann Tak Raah Bana De
Taare Ne Pasand Mainu Hethan Saare Laade
Ohna Taareyan De Vich Jadon Mainu Vekhengi
Meri Yaad Jad Aaugi Tan Pata Lagguga

Raas Na Aaya Tainu Ni
Jo Dil Da Mahal Banaya Si
Tod Ke Motti Phullan De
Uss Mahal Ch Boota Laaya Si
Ni Jiven Saanu Chadd Gayi Aan Ni Tu Alhade
Jado Tainu Koi Chaduga Taan
Oh Jiven Saanu Chadd Gayi Aan Ni Tu Alhade
Jado Tainu Koi Chaduga Taan Pata Lagguga

Ishqe De Raahan Vich Rul Ke Re Gaye Haan
Lokan Dite Taane Mene Has Ke Seh Gaye Haan
Ishqe De Raahan Vich Rul Ke Re Gaye Haan
Lokan Dite Taane Mene Has Ke Seh Gaye Haan

Sadde Pyaar Nu Tu Pairan Thalle Roldi Rahi
Jazbaat Jado Rule Ohdon Pata Lagguga

Dil Naal Laare Ni Tu Laun Waaliye
Dil Tera Jadon Tuttuga Taan Pata Lagguga
Dil Naal Laare Ni Tu Laun Waaliye
Dil Tera Jadon Tuttuga Taan Pata Lagguga

Yo Wazir!
Sidhu Moose Wala Baby!

Ho Umar De Hisaab Naal Doona Ruttba
Thoda Nahio Bahla Hi Khalaki Chalda
Ankhan Ch Atatti Koyi Sheh Boldi
Aivein Ni Koyi Duniya Ton Aaki Chalda

Ho Pichhle Koyi Karman Da Dhani Lagdae
Ya Pher Meharvaan Ae Khwaja Mithiye

Ho Chobbar De Chehre Utte Noor Dassda
Ni Ehda Uthuga Jawani Ch Janaja Mithiye
Ho Chobbar De Chehre Utte Noor Dassda
Ni Ehda Uthuga Jawani Ch Janaja Mithiye

Wazir In The Hood!

Ho Lokan Deyan Turreyan Te Paida Baniyan
Jatt Wangu Turreyan Te Raah Ni Bane
Ho Duniya De Bane Ne Chahete Bahut Ni
Fayade Wangu Kise De Khuda Ni Bane

Khud Naal Khud Jeha Khitta Chakkeya
Bas Kalla Chakkeya Ni Vaajan Mithiye

Ho Chobbar De Chehre Utte Noor Dassda
Ni Ehda Uthuga Jawani Ch Janaja Mithiye
Ho Chobbar De Chehre Utte Noor Dassda
Ni Ehda Uthuga Jawani Ch Janaja Mithiye

Ho Gairan Deyan Matheyan Te Pain Wrinkle‚Äôan
Es Hisaab Naal Koyi Jawan Ni Hunda
Manneya Tarakki Lokan Bahut Kitti Hou
Par Ainni Chheti Koyi Mahaan Ni Hunda

Takhta Zamane Da Palat Ho Gaya
Badal Ne Dittiyan Riwazan Mithiye

Ho Chobbar De Chehre Utte Noor Dassda
Ni Ehda Uthuga Jawani Ch Janaja Mithiye
Ho Chobbar De Chehre Utte Noor Dassda
Ni Ehda Uthuga Jawani Ch Janaja Mithiye

Ho Bahuteyan Di Hate Da Oh Hissa Banneya
Bahut Ohnu Aithe Chaunde Chaunde Mar Gaye
Duniya Te Church De Jhande Jhoolde
Par Ohnu Shehar Ch Haraunde Mar Gaye

Jeet Naalo Zyade Jihdi Haar Boldi
Aithon Laale Ki Ae Andaza Mithiye

Ho Chobbar De Chehre Utte Noor Dassda
Ni Ehda Uthuga Jawani Ch Janaja Mithiye
Ho Chobbar De Chehre Utte Noor Dassda
Ni Ehda Uthuga Jawani Ch Janaja Mithiye

Ho Duniya Tu Dekhi Othe Karu Sajjde
Jithe Jithe Paine Billo Pair Jatt De
Waddeyan Gharaneya Naal Peeth Jood Di
Wadde Wadde Bandeyan Naal Vair Jatt De

Ho Dass Khabbi Khan Kithe Sadde Match Da
Malwa Doaba Ki Ae Majha Mithiye

Ho Chobbar De Chehre Utte Noor Dassda
Ni Ehda Uthuga Jawani Ch Janaja Mithiye
Ho Chobbar De Chehre Utte Noor Dassda
Ni Ehda Uthuga Jawani Ch Janaja Mithiye

Ho Moddeyan De Kaal Jihde Paunda Boliyan
Biba Yalgaar Jihdi Shehri Bandi
Ho Ginti De Din Oh Jeonde Jag Te
Ant Nu Tarakki Jihdi Vairi Bandi

Ho Mard Mashookan Wangu Maut Udeekda
Khaure Kadon Khadkau Darwaja Mithiye

Ho Chobbar De Chehre Utte Noor Dassda
Ni Ehda Uthuga Jawani Ch Janaja Mithiye
Ho Chobbar De Chehre Utte Noor Dassda
Ni Ehda Uthuga Jawani Ch Janaja Mithiye

Ho Bebaak Body Language Mithiye
Geetan Vich Harkhi Jeha Touch Boldae
Aivein Nahio Duniya Khilaaf Hoyi Ni
Zor Ton Zyade Munda Sach Boldae
Zor Ton Zyade Munda Sach Boldae

Ho Zindagi Da Jungnama Phire Likhda
Badeyan Ne Sahiba Atte Heera Likhiya
Jitti Ni Taseer Kithe Mull Nakhron
Ant Nu Tu Dekh Tasveeran Vikkiyan

Ho Moose Wala Jeonda Hi Amar Ho Gaya
Bahut Aaiyan Jag Te Awajan Mithiye

Ho Chobbar De Chehre Utte Noor Dassda
Ni Ehda Uthuga Jawani Ch Janaja Mithiye
Ho Chobbar De Chehre Utte Noor Dassda
Ni Ehda Uthuga Jawani Ch Janaja Mithiye

Wazir In The Hood!

I just want to take you higher
Throw your hands up in the sky
Let's set this party off right
Players, put yo' pinky rings up to the moon
Girls, what y'all trying to do?
Twenty four karat magic in the air
Head to toe so player
Look out uh
Pop pop, it's show time (show time)
Show time (show time)
Guess who's back again?
Oh they don't know? (Go on tell 'em)
Oh they don't know? (Go on tell 'em)
I bet they know soon as we walk in (showin' up)
Wearing Cuban links (ya)
Designer minks (ya)
Inglewood's finest shoes (whoop, whoop)
Don't look too hard might hurt ya'self
Known to give the color red the blues
Oh shit, I'm a dangerous man with some money in my pocket (keep up)
So many pretty girls around me and they waking up the rocket (keep up)
Why you mad, fix ya face, ain't my fault y'all be jocking (keep up)
Players only, come on
Put your pinky rings up to the moon
Girls, what y'all trying to do?
Twenty four karat magic in the air
Head to toe so player

Second verse for the hustlas (hustlas) gangstas (gangstas)
Bad bitches and ya ugly ass friends (haha)
Can I preach? (uh oh) can I preach? (uh oh)

Spend your money like money ain't shit (whoop, whoop)

Got to blame in on Jesus
Hashtag blessed, they ain't ready for me
I'm a dangerous man with some money in my pocket (keep up)
So many pretty girls around me and they waking up the rocket (keep up)
Why you mad, fix ya face, ain't my fault y'all be jocking (keep up)

You tell me to come over, there's some games you want to play
I'm walking to your house, nobody's home
Just me and you and you and me alone
We're just playing hide and seek
It's getting hard to breathe under the sheets with you
I don't want to play no games
I'm tired of always chasing, chasing after you
I don't give a fuck about you anyways
Whoever said I gave a shit 'bout you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a play date to you
Wake up in your bedroom and there's nothing left to say
When I try to talk you're always playing board games
I wish I had monopoly over your mind
I wish I didn't care all the time
We're just playing hide and seek
It's getting hard to breathe under the sheets with you
I don't want to play no games

I never know, I never know what you need
Ring around the rosy, I want to give you, want to give you
What you need
I don't give a fuck about you anyways
Whoever said I gave a shit 'bout you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a play date to you
You know I give a fuck about you everyday
Guess it's time that I tell you the truth
If I share my toys, will you let me stay?
Don't want to leave this play date with you`

Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste buds?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk

Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral

When I roll 20 deep, it's 20 knives in the club
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem, and the hoes they wanna fuck
But, homie, ain't nothing change hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the Cut, that nigga roll that weed up
If you watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a playa or pimp
Been hit wit' a few shells, but I don't walk wit' a limp (I'm ight)
In the hood, in L.A, they saying "50 you hot"
They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac
But holla, in New York them niggas'll tell ya I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold
I'm full of focused man, my money on my mind
I got a mill out the deal and I'm still on the grind
Now shorty said she feeling my style, she feeling my flow
Her girlfriend wanna get bi and they ready to go

My flow, my show brought me the doe
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my clothes, my jewels
Look, nigga, I done came up and I ain't change
And you should love it, way more then you hate it
Nigga, you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life
You that faggot ass nigga trying to pull me back right?
When my jaws get to bumpin' in the club it's on
I wink my eye at you, bitch, if she smiles she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talking 'bout money, homie, I ain't concerned
I'm a tell you what Banks told me 'cuz go 'head switch the style up
If the niggas hate then let 'em hate and watch the money pile up
Or we go upside they head wit' a bottle of bub
They know where we fuckin' be
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub

Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dippin' again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doing 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali' weed, I smoke 'til I sleep
Wake up in the a.m., compose a beat
I bring the fire 'til you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since "Turn Out the Lights" from the World Class Wreckin Cru
I'm still at it, after-mathematics
In the home of drive-bys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through, then I give you (Still) D-R-E
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E
It ain't nothing but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether you're cooling on the corner with your fly bitch (Biatch)
Laid back in the shack, play this track
I'm representing for the gangstas all across the world
Still (Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king but the ace is back
So if you ain't up on thangs
Dr. Dre be the name still running the game
Still, got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't tripping, love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more living hard
Barbeques every day, driving fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E
Right back up in your motherfuckin' ass
Nine-five plus four pennies, add that shit up
D.R.E. right back up on top of thangs
Smoke some wit' your Dogg
No stress, no seeds, no stems, no sticks!
Some of that real sticky-icky-icky
Ooh wee! Put it in the air!
Well, you's a fool, D-R, ha-ha`

Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)

How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way)
From where we began (you know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home

It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-ote
Make me your radio
And turn me up when you feel low (turn it up a little bit)
This melody was meant for you (right there)
Just sing along to my stereo (Gym Class Hero, baby)
If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I asked you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like it yikky yeah, check it Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts
If I could only find a note to make you understand
I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my hearts a stereo that only plays for you
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-ote
Make me your radio
And turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo
to my stereo
(Oh, oh-oh, oh) just sing along to my stereo
Let's go!
If I was an old-school, fifty-pound boombox (remember them?)
Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk?
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops?
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know, we come and go like on the interstate (never know)
I think I finally found a note to make you understand
If you can hit it, sing along and take me by the hand
Just keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close (listen)
Hear my thoughts in every no-ote
Make me your radio (come on)
And turn me up when you feel low (turn it up)
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo (sing along like)
to my stereo
(Oh, oh-oh, oh) just sing along to my stereo
I only pray you'll never leave me behind (never leave me)
Because good music can be so hard to find (so hard to find)
I take your hand and pull it closer to mine (yeah)
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-ote
Make me your radio
And turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you

        ,lyrics:`Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
If you're a lover, you should know
The lonely moments just get lonelier
The longer you're in love than if you were alone
Memories turn into daydreams, become a taboo
I don't want to be afraid
The deeper that I go
It takes my breath away
Soft hearts, electric souls
Heart to heart and eyes to eyes
Is this taboo?
Baby, we built this house on memories
Take my picture now, shake it 'til you see it
And when your fantasies become your legacy
Promise me a place in your house of memories
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
I think of you from time to time
More than I thought I would
You were just too kind and I was too young to know
That's all that really matters
I was a fool
Baby, we built this house on memories
Take my picture now, shake it 'til you see it
And when your fantasies become your legacy
Promise me a place in your house of memories
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Those thoughts of past lovers, they'll always haunt me
I wish I could believe you'd never wrong me
Then will you remember me in the same way as I remember you
Baby, we built this house on memories
Take my picture now, shake it 'til you see it
And when your fantasies become your legacy
Promise me a place
Baby, we built this house on memories
Take my picture now, shake it 'til you see it
And when your fantasies become your legacy
Promise me a place in your house of memories
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
In your house of memories
Whoa, whoa
Promise me a place (whoa, whoa)`

SportsCenter, top ten
I could put the ball in the end zone
Put a bad bitch in the friendzone, ooh
This shit sound like an intro
Jetson, give me that tempo, ooh
Told Pooh he a fool with this shit
Told her don't let her friends know
In the 'Ville and I move like a don
Eating fettuccine at Vincenzo's
Me and my 'migos got that free smoke
On the West Coast, yeah, I'm talking 'bout pre-rolls
Dark haired bitch and she look like Shego
Hometown hero, feeling myself, can't murder my ego
She heard of my deep stroke
She said, "Babe, does it hurt when I deep throat?"
Certified freak ho
Hang around us and she learnin' my lingo
Back then, wasn't worried 'bout me though
In the gym tryna work on my free throw
Goddamn
Spending money at the club like Sam's
Yes, ma'am
She a lil' freak on cam
But she don't put this on the 'Gram
Lil' boys tryna diss on the 'Gram
I can't switch on the fam
Shit's hot, hit the switch on the fan
This where my head is
I feel resentment from every direction
Even some homies be wearing expressions
I be discouraged from sharing my blessings
We used to share a connection
Now it just feels like it's wearing and stretching
I'm getting real sick of taking advice
From people that never could stare at reflections
Somewhere in there is a lesson
Y'all ain't evolvin', it's very depressing
I'm at the club with the basketball team
Me and the Cardinals are sharing a section
Gotta cherish the present
I'm drinking water and wearing protection
Got a career and I'm very invested
Some people call it a scary obsession
I like to call it a passion
I can't be sitting relaxin'
PG, we getting some traction
I'm at the venue, it's packed in
I'm digging her accent
I got a B.B. Simon belt on me and she tryna get it unfastened
That's my type of distraction
That's my type and she Latin
Got my own flow and I'm 'bout to get a patent
Brand new sheets for the bed, they satin (soft, real soft)
Y'all wasn't tuned in back then
My swag, they keep jackin'
I ain't doin' no verse, quit askin'
What's poppin'? (Pooh, you a fool for this one)
Brand new whip, just hopped in

I got the mojo deals, we been trappin' like the '80s
She sucked a nigga soul, gotta Cash App
Told 'em wipe a nigga nose, say slatt, slatt
I won't never sell my soul, and I can back that
And I really wanna know, where you at, at?
I was out back, where the stash at?
Cruise the city in a bulletproof Cadillac (skrrt)
'Cause I know these niggas after where the bag at (yeah)
Gotta move smarter, gotta move harder
Niggas try to get me for my water
I'll lay his ass down on my son, or my daughter
I had the Draco with me, Dwayne Carter
Lotta niggas out here playin', ain't ballin'
I done out my whole arm in the rim, Vince Carter (yeah)
And I know probably get a key for the quarter
Shawty barely seen in double C's, I bought 'em
Got a bitch that's looking like Aaliyah, she a model

Took her to the forrest, put wood in her mouth
Bitch don't wear no shoes in my house
The private I'm flyin' in, I never wanna fly again
I'll take my chances in traffic (yeah)
She suckin' on dick, no hands with it
I just made the Rollie plain like a landing-strip
I'm a 2020 president candidate
I done put a hundred bands on Zimmerman, shit
I been movin' real gangsta', so that's why she pick a Crip
Shawty call me Crisco, 'cause I pop my shit
Got it out the mud, there's nothin' you can tell me, yeah

While only makin' conscious albums?
How y'all let the braids on TV?
How y'all let the hood at the table?
Now y'all don't even know how to rate him
Niggas lookin' like I'm a created player
Everybody who didn't pay respect
Gotta 'fess up now and pay ya debts
Gotta lay somethin' down if makin' threats
Gotta say somethin' now, don't hold ya breath
I mean, I'm floatin', I got the sauce, got the potion
I got 'em all in convulsions and emotions
I put careers in negotions
And put the body in the ocean
I made an oath when my nigga told me to go in
Then he died on a cold bench
All my old friends livin' life on a slow end

Sayin', "I'm with the band" (ayy, ayy)
Now she actin' outta pocket, tryna grab up on my pants
Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man
And they all brought a friend (yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy)
I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta (ta, pow, pow, pow)
I've been in the Hills fuckin' superstars
Feelin' like a popstar (21, 21, 21)
Drinkin' Henny, bad bitches jumpin' in the pool
And they ain't got on no bra (bra)
Hit her from the back, pullin' on her tracks
And now she screamin' out, "¬°No m√°s!" (yeah, yeah, yeah)
They like, "Savage, why you got a twelve car garage
And you only got six cars?" (21)
I ain't with the cakin', how you kiss that? (kiss that?)
Your wifey say I'm lookin' like a whole snack (big snack)
Green hundreds in my safe, I got old racks (old racks)
L.A. bitches always askin', "Where the coke at?" (21, 21)
Livin' like a rockstar, smash out on a cop car
Sweeter than a Pop-Tart, you know you are not hard
I done made the hot chart, 'member I used to trap hard
Livin' like a rockstar, I'm livin' like a rockstar (ayy)
I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta (ta, grrra-ta-ta-ta-ta)
Star, star, rockstar, rockstar, star

        ,lyrics:`May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here?
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (ah!)
It's the return of the, oh wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?
And Dr. Dre said-, nothing you idiots
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (haha)
Feminist women love Eminem
Chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who, yeah, but he's so cute though
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse, than what's goin' on in your parents bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips
And if I'm lucky you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals
Well, some of us are cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes...
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up?
Please stand up, please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up?
Please stand up, please stand up
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy
Half of you critics can't even stomach me
Let alone stand me
But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?
Why, so you guys can just lie to get me here
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hehe!
I should download her audio on mp3
And show the whole world, how you gave Eminem VD (ahh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk talk and act like me
And just might be, the next best thing, but not quite me
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up?
Please stand up, please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up?
Please stand up, please stand up
I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugar-coat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder, how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?
It's funny 'cause at the rate I'm goin' when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting
Pinchin' nurses asses while I'm jackin' off with Jergens
And I'm jerkin' but this whole bag of Viagra isn't workin'
In every single person there's a Slim Shady lurkin'
He could be workin' at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parkin' lot circling, screamin' I don't give a fuck
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady, please stand up?
And put one of those fingers, on each hand up
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time loud as you can, how does it go?
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up?
Please stand up, please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up?
Please stand up, please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up?
Please stand up, please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys, are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up?
Please stand up, please stand up
Haha, guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand up`

Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Guess who's back
Back again
Shady's back
Tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back
I've created a monster
'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more
They want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give you
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty, without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips, and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, fuck you Debbie!
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
I said "This looks like a job for me"
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
Little Hellions, kids feelin' rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin' like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, bitch!
A visionary, vision of scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass
You asked for me?
Well I'm back
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna tune it in and then I'm gonna
Enter in, endin' up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, attention please
Feel the tension, soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
I said, "This looks like a job for me"
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
A-tisket a-tasket, I go tit for tat with
Anybody who's talkin' this shit, that shit
Chris Kirk Patrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six year old baldheaded fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listen to techno
Now let's go, just gimme the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
No I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And used it to get myself wealthy
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty, without me
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
I said "This looks like a job for me"
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me

Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
